  def self.users_with_comments
    # `joins` can be surprising to SQL users. When we perform a SQL
    # join, we expect to get "wider" rows (with the columns of both
    # tables). But `joins` does not automatically return a wider row;
    # User.joins(:comments) still just returns a User:

    User.joins(:comments)
    # SELECT users.*
    #   FROM users
    #   JOIN comments
    #     ON comments.author_id = users.id
    # Note that this doesn't select any comment fields

    # `User.joins(:comments)` returns an array of `User` objects; each
    # `User` appars once for each `Comment` they've made. A `User`
    # without a `Comment` will not appear.

    # Because `joins` does not return the associated `comments`, it is
    # not used for "prefetching" like `includes` is. It is used less
    # commonly than `includes`. `joins` is used either when (1) you
    # want to use the (INNER) JOIN to filter `User`s without
    # `Comment`s, or (2) you want to perform an "aggregation".  See
    # below.
  end

  def joins_post_comment_counts(threshold = 0)
    # We use includes when we need to prefetch an association and use
    # those associated records. If we only want to *aggregate* the
    # associated records somehow, includes is wasteful, because all
    # the associated records are pulled down into the app.
    #
    # For instance, post_comment_counts just aggregates the number of
    # comments per post. We don't actually want to keep the post
    # records.
    #
    # You can use `group` to specify a group to perform an aggregation
    # in:

    posts_with_counts = self
      .posts
      .select("posts.*, COUNT(*) AS comments_count") # more in a sec
      .joins(:comments)
      .group("posts.id") # "comments.post_id" would be equivalent
    #   SELECT posts.*, COUNT(*) AS comments_count
    #     FROM posts
    #    WHERE posts.author_id = #{self.id}
    #    JOINS comments
    #       ON comments.post_id = posts.id
    # GROUP BY posts.id

    # As we've seen before using `joins` does not change the type of
    # object returned: this returns `Post` objects. But, `select` lets
    # us pick out some "bonus fields". Here, I would like to have the
    # datbase count the comments per post, and store this in a column
    # named `comments_count`. The magic is that ActiveRecord will give
    # me access to this column by dynamically adding a new method to
    # the returned `Post` objects; I can call `#comments_count` on
    # any, and it will access the value of this column.
